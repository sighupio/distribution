# Contributing Guidelines 🙌

Here at [SIGHUP][sighup-site] we appreciate and whole-heartedly welcome community
engagement and support. We try to be on top of the issues and
enhancements requested by Fury lovers, and to facilitate that we have
written some guidelines to get you started with the process.

Here are some of the quick links to get you started:

## Get in touch with us

We understand that it is easy to get lost in the wrath of Fury,
since our distro is quite modular and has a lot of moving pieces. You
can always get in touch with us with queries and suggestions on:

- [💬 #fury-distribution community Slack channel at the official Kubernetes Slack][slack-channel]
- [✉️ e-mail our engineering team](mailto:engineering@sighup.io)
