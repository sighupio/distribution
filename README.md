## Overview

SIGHUP Distribution (SD) is a [CNCF certified](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=fury-distribution) battle-tested Kubernetes distribution based purely on upstream Kubernetes.

It is developed and maintained by [SIGHUP by ReeVo][sighup-site] and the community, and it is fully open source.

> 🎯 The goal of SD is to turn any standard Kubernetes cluster into a fully-configured production-grade cluster.
<!-- separator -->
> Previously known as KFD (Kubernetes Fury Distribution), the project is now officially named SIGHUP Distribution. ReeVo has acquired SIGHUP, but the project will continue to be open-source and freely available without any changes to its functionality.

## Un-distribution model 🧬

SD uses an **un-distribution model**. This means that we:

- Rely only on open source solutions.
- Are free from vendor lock-in.
- Stay close to upstream Kubernetes and the cloud native landscape.
- Choose, configure and integrate a set of battle-tested open source tools.

## Architecture 🏗

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD045 -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/skd-architecture.png" width="800px"/>
</p>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 MD045 -->

SIGHUP Distribution is structured on modules, and each module has a set of packages.

- A package is a single unit of functionality.
- A module groups packages that are functionally related together.

> All modules are open source, widely used, easily customizable, and pre-configured with sane defaults and tested to work well together.

The standard way to deploy SD is to:

- Deploy all the [Core Modules](#core-modules-) of the distribution using [furyctl][furyctl].
- Deploy (if needed) any of the [Addon modules](#add-on-modules-) using [furyctl plugin][furyctl-plugins] feature.

See the getting started section below for more information.

### Recommended Hardware Requirements

SD is a modular and composable system, so hardware requirements ultimately depend on the modules and configuration chosen. Having said that, for a production-grade cluster a good starting point would be:

A SD production grade cluster will be composed of 3 node pools:

- Control Plane: 3 nodes in HA.
- Infrastructure: 3 nodes dedicated to running the infrastructural components of SD (monitoring, logging, policy enforcement, etc., i.e. the modules).
- Workers: where the application workload will run. This is up to you.
- Load Balancers (optional): for on-premises installations, 2 load balancers in HA can be deployed to forward traffic to the control plane and the ingress controllers running in the infrastructure nodes.

#### Nodes sizing

| Node Role      | CPU (cores) | RAM (GB) | Disk (GB) | Qty. |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------- | --------- | ---- |
| Control Plane  | 2           | 8        | 50        | 3    |
| Infrastructure | 4           | 16       | 50        | 3    |
| Load Balancer  | 2           | 2        | 50        | 2    |

#### Storage

Some modules rely on persistent storage via PersistentVolumeClaims, by default (but configurable) the following capacity will be used:

| Description                                | Size (GB) |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------: |
| Prometheus (metrics storage)               |       150 |
| MinIO Monitoring (metrics storage, 20GBx6) |       120 |
| MinIO Logging (logs storage, 20GBx6)       |       120 |
| OpenSearch (logs storage)                  |        30 |
| MinIO Tracing (traces storage)             |       120 |
| **Total**                                  |   **540** |

### Core Modules 📦

Core modules provide essential functionality to the distribution for production-grade clusters.

## CNCF Certified 🎓

Each version of the SIGHUP Distribution that introduces compatibility with a new version of Kubernetes goes through a [conformance certification process with the CNCF][cncf-conformance]. Certified solutions are validated to ensure a set of guarantees such as consistency, timely updates and confirmability.

SD has been certified by the [CNCF] (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) as a _Certified Kubernetes Distribution_ for all Kubernetes versions since [Kubernetes 1.12](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pull/619). Clicking on the badge below you can see the certification process for the latest version of SD:
